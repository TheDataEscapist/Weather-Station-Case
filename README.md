# Weather-Station-Case
𝐒𝐢𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:
Led this SQL project, aimed at building a comprehensive weather data system, leveraging robust database design and query capabilities to analyze meteorological data effectively.

𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤:
The objective was to create and manage a relational database to store, manipulate, and analyze weather station data. The project required the use of SQL DDL and DML commands, aggregate functions, and various SQL operations to ensure efficient data management and insightful reporting.

𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:
>𝑫𝑫𝑳 𝑪𝒐𝒎𝒎𝒂𝒏𝒅𝒔- Created the database schema with two tables - station and stats. The station table includes columns such as ID (Primary Key), CITY, STATE, LAT_N, and LONG_W. The stats table includes ID (Foreign Key from 'station'), MONTH, TEMP_F, and RAIN_I.
>𝑫𝑴𝑳 𝑪𝒐𝒎𝒎𝒂𝒏𝒅𝒔- Inserted and updated records in both tables, ensuring accurate weather data.
>𝑨𝒈𝒈𝒓𝒆𝒈𝒂𝒕𝒆 𝑭𝒖𝒏𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔 & 𝑹𝑶𝑼𝑵𝑫() 𝑭𝒖𝒏𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏- Calculated max and min temperatures, along with average temperature and rainfall, thereby rounding the results for readability.
>𝑰𝒏𝒏𝒆𝒓 𝑱𝒐𝒊𝒏 & 𝑺𝒖𝒃𝒒𝒖𝒆𝒓𝒚- Retrieved comprehensive data by joining the two tables, and used subqueries for complex data extraction.
>𝑮𝒓𝒐𝒖𝒑 𝑩𝒚 & 𝑶𝒓𝒅𝒆𝒓 𝑩𝒚- Grouped data by city, and ordered data by month and temperature, in separate queries, to highlight trends and anomalies.
>𝑰𝑵 𝑶𝒑𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒐𝒓- Filtered data to produce specific results for targeted analysis.

𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐥𝐭:
The project culminated in a dynamic database capable of detailed weather analysis, facilitating accurate reporting and insightful data-driven decisions.
