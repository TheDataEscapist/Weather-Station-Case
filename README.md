# Weather-Station-Case
This project leverages SQL queries for creating and populating tables, performing calculations, and updating records. The database comprises of 2 tables - station and stats. The table 'station' consists of columns like ID int PK, CITY char(20), STATE char(2), LAT_N int, and LONG_W int. Here, the column station.ID is the Primary Key. The table 'stats' consists of columns like ID int, MONTH int, TEMP_F decimal(5,1), and RAIN_I decimal(5,2), where stats.ID is the Foreign Key, referenced from the ID column of the 'station' table.
